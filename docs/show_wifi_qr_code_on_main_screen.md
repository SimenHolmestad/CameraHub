# Show WiFi-code on screen
If you know some (or all) of your photobooth users will not be connected to the your WiFi network, it might be a good idea to provide the users with a QR code to connect to the WiFi. Creating such a QR code can be accomplished quite easily with the CameraHub system.

To create a WiFi QR code you must first create a file named `network_details.json` in the root directory of the project (inside the `CameraHub` folder). The file should be on the following format:

```
{
  "wifi_name": "my_wifi_SSID",
  "wifi_protocol": "WPA/WPA2",
  "wifi_password": "my_super_secret_password",
  "description": "Scan qr code to connect to my_wifi_SSID!"
}
```

After creating the `network_details.json` file, run or deploy the application (again) for the WiFi QR Code to be created and shown on screen. The WiFi QR code will be saved with the file path `backend/static/qr_codes/wifi_qr_code.png`.

**Warning:** The password of your network will be stored in plaintext inside the WiFi QR code, which might not be ideal depending on your situation.
